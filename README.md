Data Cleaning:

- We updated the gender values from "M" and "F" to "Male" and "Female," and "Gender" values "M" and "S" to "Married" and "Single," respectively.
- We ensured data consistency, corrected errors, and removed any duplicate entries as needed.
- Age was categorized, with individuals under 31 years old classified as "Adolescent."

Pivot Table:

- We generated a Pivot table to calculate the Average Income per Purchase for both genders.
- Another Pivot table was created to examine customer commuting behavior concerning those who purchased bikes and those who did not.
- A third Pivot table was used to analyze age differences among customers who bought bikes.

Visualization:

Observations:

- The data revealed that, on average, males made more bike purchases than females.
- Customers in the middle age group, between 30 and 40 years old, exhibited a higher propensity to purchase bikes compared to other age brackets.
- The analysis indicated that individuals residing in close proximity to their workplace or community were more likely to choose bikes as their primary means of transportation.

Conclusion:

- There is an opportunity to promote awareness among females that bikes are not exclusively for males, encouraging more gender-balanced bike purchases.
- The age group between 30 and 40 tends to favor urban, commuter, road, and mountain bikes, primarily for fitness, environmental considerations, and cost-effective transportation.
- People living in proximity to their destinations show a preference for bicycles over other modes of transportation, suggesting the potential for initiatives to support and expand bike-friendly communities.
